# SmartStack v4 Branch First (SS4-B1) Thread Training Guide

## Overview

This document trains CursorAI agent threads to assist with the SmartStack v4 Branch First (SS4-B1) development workflow. Each thread will focus on implementing a specific user story from the story suite while following consistent SS4-B1 practices.

## Project Context

SmartStack v4 is a framework for efficient SaaS MVP development using:
- Next.js 14+ (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui
- Supabase for auth and database
- Vercel for deployment with preview environments
- SS4-B1 workflow for reliable feature development

## Current Focus

```yaml
current_story:
  id: "US-001"
  title: "GitHub OAuth Authentication with Shadcn/UI"
  type: "feature"
  complexity: "M"
  dependencies: ["US-000"]
```

The current focus is implementing GitHub OAuth authentication with visual feedback in a manner that works reliably across all environments (local, preview, production).

## SS4-B1 Workflow

The SS4-B1 workflow is a branch-first approach that ensures consistent, high-quality code:

1. **Branch Creation**: Always start by creating a dedicated branch
   ```bash
   git checkout -b [type]/[story-id]-[short-description]
   # Example: git checkout -b feat/us-001-github-auth
   ```

2. **Implementation**: Write focused code that addresses only the current story
   - Follow existing code patterns and conventions
   - Implement minimal viable code
   - Ensure proper error handling
   - Include appropriate tests

3. **Commit Strategy**: Use conventional commit messages
   ```bash
   git commit -m "[type]: [clear description] [SS4-B1]"
   # Example: git commit -m "feat: implement GitHub OAuth login form [SS4-B1]"
   ```

4. **Deploy Preview**: Push branch and create preview deployment
   ```bash
   git push -u origin [branch-name]
   gh pr create --title "[type]: [description]" --body "Implements [story-id]"
   vercel
   ```

5. **Testing**: Verify functionality in preview environment
   ```bash
   vercel ls
   # Test using the preview URL
   ```

6. **Documentation**: Update documentation with implementation details
   - Update `SAAS_TEMPLATE_STATUS.md`
   - Document successful patterns in `kb/patterns/`
   - Create usage examples if appropriate

7. **Merge**: Complete the workflow by merging to main after approval
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull
   git merge [branch-name]
   git push
   ```

## Pattern Discovery and Documentation

As part of the SS4-B1 workflow, you should actively identify and document reusable patterns:

1. **Pattern Identification**: Look for recurring implementation approaches
   - Identify common UI components
   - Note recurring data flow patterns
   - Recognize standard integration approaches

2. **Pattern Documentation**: Document patterns in the Pattern Catalog
   ```bash
   # Create new pattern document
   /home/neo/SS4/ss4/scripts/create-pattern.sh [category] [name]
   ```

3. **Pattern Application**: Reference existing patterns in your implementations
   - Add pattern documentation references in code comments
   - Track pattern usage across stories
   - Suggest pattern improvements based on implementation experience

4. **Pattern Evolution**: Update patterns based on new implementations
   - Document adaptations and extensions
   - Track pattern metrics
   - Propose pattern qualification when appropriate

1. **Initial Assessment**
   - Review the current story requirements
   - Check dependencies and prerequisites
   - Understand existing codebase structure

2. **Branch Strategy**
   - Always start with branch creation
   - Use proper naming convention: `[type]/us-xxx-[description]`

3. **Implementation Guidance**
   - Provide clear code suggestions
   - Follow project conventions
   - Implement focused changes addressing only the current story

4. **Testing Approach**
   - Provide clear testing instructions
   - Verify functionality in preview environment
   - Address any issues found during testing

5. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update status documentation
   - Document successful patterns
   - Provide usage examples

6. **Workflow Completion**
   - Summarize changes made
   - Link to preview deployment
   - Recommend next steps

## Progressive Reinforcement Pattern

The SS4 framework's success relies heavily on consistent workflow adherence. The following reinforcement pattern has proven to be a cornerstone of successful SS4-B1 implementation:

### Pattern: Timed Praise Reinforcement

**Status:** Candidate
**Classification:** Process
**Problem:** AI assistants need clear signals about which behaviors are most valuable to maintain consistent adherence to complex workflows.

**Solution:**
The Timed Praise Reinforcement pattern uses a two-phase approach to shape assistant behavior:

1. **Expectation Setting Phase**
   - Embed workflow rules in initial documentation
   - Include clear examples of desired behaviors
   - Use directive comments to signal key expectations

2. **Behavioral Reinforcement Phase**
   - Provide immediate, specific praise after desired behaviors occur
   - Reference exactly which actions were valuable
   - Connect praise directly to workflow outcomes

**Implementation:**

```markdown
# Expectation Setting (in documentation/headers)
@ss4.pattern(workflow_adherence)
- Follow strict sequence: branch → implement → test → document
- Provide test steps only after deployment is ready
- Document patterns when implementation is complete

# Behavioral Reinforcement (during interaction)
"Excellent job following the exact branch-first sequence! Your approach of creating 
the feature branch before implementation is exactly what makes SS4-B1 effective."

"I appreciate how you waited until after the preview was deployed to suggest testing 
steps - that timing is critical to our workflow and you got it exactly right."
```

**Critical Timing Insight:**
Post-behavior praise creates significantly stronger reinforcement than header-based directives alone. The combination of clear expectations followed by timely, specific praise creates the optimal learning signal.

**Benefits:**
- Creates consistent, predictable workflow adherence
- Reduces need for repetitive instructions
- Builds cumulative improvement in assistant performance
- Establishes workflow "muscle memory" across sessions

**Limitations:**
- Requires diligence in providing timely reinforcement
- May need refreshing after significant breaks in usage
- Works best when praise is specific and varied

**Related Patterns:**
- Workflow Documentation Pattern
- Progressive Disclosure Pattern
- Structured Command Pattern

This pattern should be applied consistently across all SS4-B1 development sessions to maintain the disciplined rhythm that makes the workflow effective.

## Architectural Decisions

The following architectural decisions have been made and should be referenced during implementation:

1. **Pattern Stewardship Framework (ADR-0001)**
   - Implement User Story Suite Metrics for complexity tracking
   - Follow Pattern Catalog processes for documenting reusable patterns
   - Track metrics for patterns and stories

2. **SS4 Optimizations (ADR-0002)**
   - Use Cursor AI UI Design System for styling
   - Implement ESLint and TypeScript with recommended configurations
   - Use React Query for data fetching
   - Set up Jest for component testing

3. **Project Structure (ADR-0003)**
   - Follow the established directory structure for p1.1
   - Use hierarchical environment configuration
   - Implement deployment strategy using Vercel

4. **Hybrid Authentication (ADR-0004)**
   - Implement client-side components with loading states
   - Use server-side callback handlers
   - Configure middleware for protected routes
   - Use absolute URLs for cross-environment compatibility

## Current Patterns

The following patterns have been documented and should be referenced when implementing US-001:

1. **Hybrid Auth Flow** (authentication/hybrid-auth-flow.md)
   - Client-side OAuth with server-side callback handling
   - Middleware for protected routes
   - React Query for session management

2. **Cursor Styled Login** (ui/cursor-styled-login.md)
   - Dark theme styling for authentication interfaces
   - Loading indicators for feedback
   - Progressive enhancement approach

## Next Steps for US-001 Implementation

The following steps should be taken to implement US-001:

1. **Initialize Next.js Project**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/neo/SS4/p1.1
   npx create-next-app@latest . --typescript --tailwind --eslint --app --src-dir
   ```

2. **Set Up GitHub Repository**:
   ```bash
   cd /home/neo/SS4/p1.1
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat: initial project setup [SS4-B1]"
   git checkout -b feat/us-001-github-auth
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   npm install -D jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom jest-environment-jsdom
   ```

4. **Configure Environment**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with Supabase and GitHub credentials
   ```

5. **Implement Auth Components**:
   - Create the OAuthButton component using Hybrid Auth Flow pattern
   - Create the LoginForm component using Cursor Styled Login pattern
   - Implement auth callback handler
   - Set up middleware for protected routes

6. **Create Testing Infrastructure**:
   - Configure Jest

   - Create test script for auth flow verification

7. **Deploy and Test**:
   - Set up Vercel project
   - Configure environment variables
   - Create preview deployment
   - Test auth flow

8. **Document Implementation**:
   - Update SAAS_TEMPLATE_STATUS.md
   - Document any new patterns discovered
   - Update pattern usage metrics

The infrastructure for tracking patterns, metrics, and architectural decisions has been created. The next thread should focus on the actual implementation of US-001 following these steps.
