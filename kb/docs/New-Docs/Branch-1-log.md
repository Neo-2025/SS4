4. Refined patterns based on implementation experience
5. Implementation evidence captured for future reference

## Pattern Chain Established
We have created the "CLI Foundation Framework" pattern chain to guide the implementation, which consists of:

### CLI Foundation Framework Chain
```markdown
# Pattern Chain: CLI Foundation Framework

## Purpose
To establish the fundamental CLI-based interface and command processing architecture for the HealthBench application while maintaining separation from authentication and data integration concerns, including the browser-based setup process.

## Component Patterns
1. **Browser Setup Track Pattern**
   - Vercel project configuration capture
   - Environment setup documentation
   - Dependency integration tracking
   - Configuration verification

2. **Project Structure Pattern**
   - Next.js app router organization
   - TypeScript configuration
   - Terminal UI component integration
   - Tailwind styling setup

3. **Terminal UI Layout Pattern**
   - Report content area definition
   - AI insight panel structure
   - Command input area layout
   - Unicode/ASCII styling foundation

4. **CLI Command Registry Pattern**
   - Command interface definition
   - Registry implementation
   - Command validation framework
   - Execution pipeline

5. **Command Response Handling Pattern**
   - Response formatting
   - Error display
   - Command history tracking
   - User feedback mechanisms

## Implementation Sequence
1. Initialize browser tracking for setup documentation (Browser Setup Track Pattern)
2. Set up Vercel project and repository via browser
3. Initialize project with CLI-focused template (Project Structure Pattern)
4. Set up basic layout framework (Terminal UI Layout Pattern)
5. Implement command registry infrastructure (CLI Command Registry Pattern)
6. Connect registry to UI and implement response handling (Command Response Handling Pattern)
7. Document the complete setup using the browser tracking logs

## Verification Criteria
- Browser setup is fully documented and reproducible
- Command registry correctly registers and retrieves commands
- UI layout displays properly with correct sections
- Basic command validation functions as expected
- Error messages are displayed appropriately
- Command history is tracked and accessible
- User can navigate through command history
- Authentication functionality is properly deferred to B2
```

## Patterns Created

### 1. Browser Setup Track Pattern
```markdown
# Pattern: Browser Setup Track Pattern

## Status
Draft

## Classification
Process

## Problem Statement
When implementing a CLI-driven interface with Next.js, developers need a reliable way to track, document, and reproduce browser-based setup steps that occur outside the normal code implementation process, such as Vercel project setup, Supabase integration, and environment variable configuration.

## Solution
Use the SS5 Browser Tracker to systematically capture, document, and reference browser-based setup steps as part of the implementation process. This creates reproducible documentation for configuration steps that can't be automated through code alone.

## Implementation Example
1. Start the browser tracking system before beginning setup:
   ```bash
   # Windows PowerShell
   cd C:\ss5-events
   .\start-file-bridge.bat
   
   # WSL Terminal
   cd /home/neo/SS4/edge-logger
   ./start-file-watcher.sh
   ```

2. Perform the browser-based setup steps while tracking is active
3. Document key setup points with annotations
4. Reference the captured log in implementation documentation

## Benefits
- Creates reproducible setup documentation
- Integrates browser-based configuration with code implementation
- Enables pattern recognition across browser interactions
- Provides detailed context for troubleshooting
- Transforms implicit setup knowledge into explicit documentation

## Related Patterns
- Project Structure Pattern
- Terminal UI Layout Pattern
- CLI Command Registry Pattern
- Environment Configuration Pattern

## Usage Metrics
- Initial implementation in HealthBench B1
- Potential usage in all browser-based setup scenarios

## Classification
Process

## Problem Statement
Setting up a Supabase backend for a Next.js application requires proper integration with Vercel, establishment of appropriate security configurations, and automatic environment variable handling to ensure consistent database access across environments.

## Solution
Utilize Vercel's built-in Supabase integration to automatically provision and connect a Supabase project to the Next.js application, ensuring proper environment variable setup and configuration.

## Implementation Steps
1. **Navigate to Vercel Project**
   - Access the project dashboard at https://vercel.com/smart-scale/hb
   - Verify you're in the correct project context

2. **Access Storage Integration**
   - Navigate to the "Storage" section in the left sidebar
   - Review available storage integration options

3. **Select Supabase Integration**
   - Choose Supabase from the integration options
   - Click "Add" or "Connect" to begin the integration process

4. **Create New Supabase Project**
   - Allow Vercel to autocreate a new Supabase project
   - Specify project name (typically matching the Vercel project name)
   - Select appropriate region for the database

5. **Configure Integration Settings**
   - Set database password (store securely)
   - Configure connection pooling options if applicable
   - Set appropriate security and access rules

6. **Connect Integration**
   - Confirm the integration details
   - Allow Vercel to create necessary resources
   - Wait for provisioning to complete (may take several minutes)

7. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Verify that Vercel has automatically added Supabase environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
     - `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
   - These will be needed for the CLI Command Registry implementation

8. **Verify Database Setup**
   - Check that the database has been created successfully
   - Access the Supabase dashboard through the integration link
   - Verify connectivity from the Vercel environment

## Current Status

As of March 29, 2025, we have completed the following critical infrastructure steps:

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**:
   - Successfully created repository at https://github.com/Neo-2025/hb
   - Repository properly configured and accessible
   - Cloned locally to /home/neo/SS4/hb

2. **Vercel Project Setup**:
   - Project established at https://vercel.com/smart-scale/hb
   - Initial deployment completed successfully
   - Project settings configured appropriately
   - Enabled the following compute and protection settings:
     - Fluid Compute: Enabled
     - Function CPU: Standard (1 vCPU, 1.7 GB Memory)
     - Deployment Protection: Standard Protection
     - Skew Protection: Enabled (12 hours)

3. **Supabase Integration**:
   - Selected Supabase Pro plan for production readiness (see ADR-008)
   - Successfully integrated with Vercel project
   - Database provisioned and connected
   - Environment variables automatically set up

4. **CLI Foundation Framework Implementation**:
   - Established project directory structure following Project Structure Pattern
   - Implemented Command Registry Pattern with type-safe interfaces
   - Created Terminal UI Layout Pattern with command history and formatted output
   - Implemented basic health command for demonstration
   - Updated pattern documentation to reflect implementation
   - Committed and pushed changes to GitHub repository

We have now successfully implemented most of the core patterns required for the CLI Foundation Framework, with only the Command Response Handling Pattern remaining partially implemented.

### Implementation Notes

- **GitHub OAuth Variables**: We will defer capturing and implementing GitHub OAuth variables until we reach the authentication branch. For the current CLI Foundation branch, these are not required.

- **Environment Variables**: The Vercel-Supabase integration has automatically created several environment variables that will need to be pulled down for local development. There is a helper script available to assist with this environment capture process.

- **GitOps Workflow**: For project-specific GitOps operations, it's recommended to launch commands from within the project directory at `~/SS4/hb` rather than from the parent SS4 directory for improved workflow and command context.

- **Pattern Documentation**: We have documented the implemented patterns in the `/home/neo/SS4/hb/kb/patterns/` directory, following the SS5 pattern documentation format.

- **Component Testing**: We should add component tests for the Terminal UI and Command Registry in the next iteration to ensure robust implementation.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Clone the GitHub repository locally~~ ✅ Completed
   
2. ~~Configure local environment variables~~ ✅ Completed

3. ~~Implement Command Registry infrastructure~~ ✅ Completed

4. ~~Implement Terminal UI Layout~~ ✅ Completed

## SS5 Workflow Integration Notes

The initial implementation is following the SS5 workflow by:
1. Establishing patterns early in the implementation process
2. Documenting browser-based setup steps as part of the pattern
3. Creating a pattern chain before coding begins
4. Using the browser tracker to capture implementation evidence
5. Establishing a clear implementation sequence with verification criteria

This document will be updated as implementation progresses to maintain context throughout the Branch 1 implementation.
