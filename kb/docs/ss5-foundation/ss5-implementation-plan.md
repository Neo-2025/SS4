# Copy existing bootstrap script
cp /home/neo/SS4/bootstrap-us000.sh /home/neo/SS4/bootstrap-scripts/bootstrap-us000.sh

# Create script for p1.1 project
cp /path/to/existing/p1.1/bootstrap.sh /home/neo/SS4/bootstrap-scripts/bootstrap-p1.1.sh || touch /home/neo/SS4/bootstrap-scripts/bootstrap-p1.1.sh
```

### 4.2. Create Bootstrap Script Generation Tool
```bash
cat > /home/neo/SS4/ss5/scripts/generate-bootstrap.sh << 'EOF'
#!/bin/bash
# Bootstrap Script Generator for SS5 Projects

PROJECT_NAME=$1
USS_PATH=$2
OUTPUT_PATH=$3

if [ -z "$PROJECT_NAME" ] || [ -z "$USS_PATH" ] || [ -z "$OUTPUT_PATH" ]; then
  echo "Usage: $0 project_name uss_path output_path"
  exit 1
fi

echo "Generating bootstrap script for $PROJECT_NAME..."
echo "Analyzing User Story Suite at $USS_PATH..."

# Template-based generation logic would go here
# This would analyze the USS and create appropriate bootstrap script

echo "Bootstrap script created at $OUTPUT_PATH"
EOF

chmod +x /home/neo/SS4/ss5/scripts/generate-bootstrap.sh
```

### 4.3. Document Bootstrap Script Pattern

```

## Phase 5: ADR and Documentation Updates

### 5.1. Create New ADR for Pattern-Based Development
```bash
cat > /home/neo/SS4/kb/ADR/ADR-0006-pattern-based-development.md << 'EOF'
# ADR-0006: Pattern-Based Development

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Traditional template-based approaches to project structure are inflexible and often require significant modification for specific use cases. We need an approach that offers both consistency and adaptability.

## Decision
We will adopt a pattern-based development approach where:
1. Reusable solutions are identified and documented as patterns
2. Patterns are classified and qualified through implementation
3. Project-specific pattern chains are synthesized for user stories
4. Implementation is guided by prompt chains derived from pattern chains

## Consequences
### Positive
- Increased adaptability to project-specific requirements
- Improved knowledge transfer between projects
- Progressive refinement of solutions across implementations
- Reduced redundancy and improved code quality

### Negative
- Requires additional documentation effort
- Pattern stewardship adds overhead to development process
- Learning curve for new developers to understand pattern catalog

## Implementation
1. Establish Pattern Meta Catalog with standardized documentation
2. Create pattern qualification process (Draft → Candidate → Validated → Core)
3. Implement pattern chain synthesis for user stories
4. Create prompt chains for AI-assisted implementation

## Related ADRs
- ADR-0001: Pattern Stewardship Framework

## References
- SmartStack v5 Specification
- HealthBench US-000 and US-001 implementations
EOF
```

### 5.2. Update SS5 Specification with Implementation Details
Add a new section to the SS5 specification document with implementation guidance.

### 5.3. Create Pattern Application Guidelines
```bash
cat > /home/neo/SS4/kb/docs/ss5-pattern-application-guidelines.md << 'EOF'
# SmartStack v5 Pattern Application Guidelines

This document provides practical guidance for applying SS5 patterns to implement User Story Suites.

## Pattern Selection Process
1. Read and understand the user story requirements
2. Identify required capabilities and technical components
3. Search the pattern catalog for relevant patterns
4. Evaluate pattern qualification status and applicability
5. Select patterns based on requirements coverage and compatibility

## Pattern Adaptation Process
1. Identify project-specific requirements not covered by patterns
2. Determine required adaptations to selected patterns
3. Document adaptations in pattern chain
4. Implement adaptations following pattern principles

## Pattern Chain Implementation
1. Follow implementation sequence defined in pattern chain
2. Use prompt chains for AI-assisted implementation
3. Document new patterns discovered during implementation
4. Provide feedback on pattern effectiveness

## Pattern Documentation Workflow
1. Identify potentially reusable solutions
2. Evaluate against pattern identification checklist
3. Document using standardized template
4. Submit for pattern qualification review
5. Update pattern catalog with new patterns

## Common Pitfalls
1. Over-engineering: Using complex patterns for simple problems
2. Under-documentation: Failing to document adaptations and new patterns
3. Pattern drift: Deviating from pattern principles during implementation
4. Isolation: Creating patterns that don't compose well with others

## Success Metrics
1. Implementation time reduction through pattern reuse
2. Code consistency across projects
3. Pattern qualification progression
4. Knowledge transfer effectiveness

## Phase 7: React Snippet Integration

### 7.1. Document React Snippet Integration Pattern
```bash
cat > /home/neo/SS4/ss5/patterns/integration/react-snippet-integration.md << 'EOF'
# Pattern: React Snippet Integration

## Status
Candidate

## Classification
Integration

## Problem
Inconsistent React implementation patterns across components and projects lead to maintenance challenges, knowledge transfer issues, and reduced code quality.

## Context
This pattern should be applied when implementing React components within SS5 projects to ensure consistency, reduce boilerplate, and improve maintainability.

## Solution
Standardized code snippets based on the mature "ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets v4.4.3" extension, which provides "Extensions for React, React-Native and Redux in JS/TS with ES7+ syntax. Customizable. Built-in integration with prettier."

### Key Adopted Snippets

#### Functional Component Creation
- `rafce` → React Arrow Function Component with Export
```jsx
import React from 'react'

const ComponentName = () => {
  return <div>ComponentName</div>
}

export default ComponentName
```

#### Hook Usage
- `useS` → useState Hook
```jsx
const [state, setState] = useState(initialState)
```

- `useE` → useEffect Hook
```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  // Effect logic
  return () => {
    // Cleanup logic
  }
}, [dependencies])

## Phase 10: AI-Pattern Collaboration Model Implementation

### 10.1. Update Pattern Qualification Process
```bash
# Create updated documentation for the qualification process
cat > /home/neo/SS4/kb/docs/3.3/SS5_Pattern_Qualification_Process.md << 'EOF'
# SS5 Pattern Qualification Process

This document describes the enhanced qualification process for patterns in the SS5 framework, now including the Adaptive status level and guidance for CAI-A collaboration.

## Pattern Status Levels

1. **Draft**
   - Initial implementation in at least 1 context
   - Basic documentation with minimal structure
   - **CAI-A Guidance**: Consider as inspiration only; proactively develop better solutions

2. **Candidate**
   - Used in at least 2 contexts
   - More complete documentation with examples
   - **CAI-A Guidance**: Consider as a starting point but freely adapt; suggest improvements

3. **Validated**
   - Proven in 3+ contexts
   - Comprehensive documentation
   - **CAI-A Guidance**: Use as default approach but adapt to context; document adaptations

4. **Adaptive**
   - Proven pattern with recognized variation points
   - Documentation includes Core Elements and Adaptation Points
   - **CAI-A Guidance**: Follow the pattern's core principles but actively optimize implementation details

5. **Core**
   - Essential foundational pattern (e.g., SS5-B1 Workflow)
   - Extensive documentation and examples
   - **CAI-A Guidance**: Must adhere closely; modifications limited to non-architectural aspects

## Qualification Process

The qualification of a pattern progresses through these stages:

1. **Pattern Identification**
   - Pattern emerges during implementation
   - CAI-A or developer identifies potential pattern
   - Basic documentation created in Draft status

2. **Pattern Candidate Review**
   - Pattern used in a second context
   - CAI-A documents adaptations made
   - Pattern Steward reviews for promotion to Candidate

3. **Pattern Validation**
   - Pattern used in 3+ contexts
   - CAI-A provides implementation insights
   - Pattern Steward reviews for promotion to Validated

4. **Adaptation Assessment**
   - Pattern evaluated for adaptation points
   - CAI-A identifies areas for optimization
   - Pattern Steward designates Adaptive status with clear adaptation boundaries

5. **Core Pattern Designation**
   - Reserved for essential architectural patterns
   - Requires extensive testing and usage
   - Pattern Steward designates Core status with strict adherence requirements
EOF
```

### 10.2. Update Pattern Documentation Templates
1. Add AI Collaboration sections to pattern template
2. Add YAML frontmatter to pattern and chain templates
3. Update existing documentation to include AI collaboration guidance

### 10.3. Create AI Prompting Framework
```bash
# Create AI prompting framework documentation
cat > /home/neo/SS4/kb/docs/3.3/SS5_AI_Prompting_Framework.md << 'EOF'
# SS5 AI Prompting Framework

This document provides guidance for effective prompting of CursorAI-Agent (CAI-A) when implementing patterns in the SS5 framework.

## Baseline Prompt Template for Pattern Application

```
I need to implement [description of feature or component].

Potentially relevant SS5 patterns:
- [Pattern 1] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft])
- [Pattern 2] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft])

For Core patterns (currently SS5-B1), please adhere closely to the established approach.
For other patterns, you're empowered to adapt or create new solutions as needed.
Please document any adaptations or improvements you make to patterns.
```

## Pattern Selection Prompts

```
Based on the user story [story description], please identify relevant patterns from the SS5 Pattern Meta Catalog.

For each pattern, please indicate:
1. Pattern name and status
2. Relevance to the user story
3. Potential adaptations needed
4. Implementation considerations
```

## Pattern Chain Synthesis Prompts

```
Using the following patterns:
- [Pattern 1] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft])
- [Pattern 2] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft])

Please create a pattern chain for implementing [user story description].

Include:
1. Component patterns with adaptation guidance
2. Implementation sequence
3. Verification criteria
```

## Implementation Prompts

```
I need to implement [component/feature] following the [Pattern Chain Name].

The chain includes the following patterns:
- [Pattern 1] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft], Adherence: [Strict/Principles/Flexible])
- [Pattern 2] (Status: [Core/Adaptive/Validated/Candidate/Draft], Adherence: [Strict/Principles/Flexible])

Please lead the implementation with appropriate pattern application and document any adaptations.
```

## Pattern Documentation Prompts

```
Based on the implementation of [component/feature], please document:

1. Any adaptations made to existing patterns
2. Any new patterns that emerged during implementation
3. Updates needed to pattern documentation
4. Pattern metrics and insights
```

## Best Practices

1. Always include pattern status information in prompts
2. Clearly indicate where adaptation is encouraged vs. where strict adherence is required
3. Ask CAI-A to document adaptations and improvements
4. Prompt for implementation insights that could lead to pattern evolution
5. Review CAI-A's pattern applications and provide feedback for improvement
EOF
```

### 10.4. Update SS5-B1 Workflow with Collaborative Model
1. Revise workflow steps to include CAI-A and Pattern Steward responsibilities
2. Document collaborative approach for each workflow step
3. Update verification process to include pattern status considerations

### 10.5. Implement Pattern Metrics for AI Adaptations
1. Enhance pattern metrics to track AI adaptations
2. Create metrics for adaptation value
3. Implement dashboard showing pattern evolution through AI collaboration

   - Document all significant adaptations for pattern evolution
   - Use metrics to evaluate adaptation effectiveness

4. **Pattern Evolution Process**
   - Regularly review CAI-A adaptations for pattern improvements
   - Promote patterns based on usage metrics and adaptation value
   - Document successful adaptations as pattern improvements

5. **Knowledge Sharing**
   - Capture CAI-A insights about patterns and implementation
   - Share implementation learnings between projects
   - Use pattern metrics to guide improvements

## Measurement and Improvement

Regularly assess the effectiveness of the collaborative model using:

1. **Pattern Evolution Metrics**
   - Number of patterns progressing through qualification levels
   - Number of valuable adaptations incorporated into patterns
   - Reduction in implementation time through pattern reuse

2. **Implementation Efficiency**
   - Time to implement user stories using the collaborative model
   - Code quality and defect rates in pattern-based implementations
   - Developer satisfaction with pattern guidance

3. **Documentation Quality**
