# Branch 3.6: API Integration with Resilience Patterns

This branch implements real API integration with the CMS Provider Data API, along with database persistence and resilience patterns to ensure robust operation even during API failures.

## Key Features

1. **Real API Integration**: 
   - CMS Provider Data API client with proper error handling
   - Structured data mapping between API and application models

2. **Database Persistence**:
   - Supabase database integration for agency data
   - User-specific data isolation with Row Level Security (RLS)
   - API response caching for offline operation

3. **Resilience Patterns**:
   - Circuit Breaker pattern for preventing cascading failures
   - Retry Policy with exponential backoff for transient issues
   - Multi-Layer Fallback with database and static fallbacks
   - Visual indicators for fallback data in the UI

4. **System Monitoring**:
   - `status` command to check system resilience status
   - `reset` command to manually reset the circuit breaker
   - Transparent fallback mode indicators

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

The implementation includes a database schema with tables for:
- `agencies` - Stores agency data with user ownership
- `agency_groups` - Manages agency grouping (Org, Comp, Target)
- `api_cache` - Caches API responses with expiration

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables are supported:
- `CMS_API_KEY` - API key for the CMS Provider Data API
- `CMS_API_BASE_URL` - Base URL for the API (defaults to "https://data.cms.gov/provider-data/api/1")
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD` - Number of failures before opening the circuit (default: 5)
- `CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_TIMEOUT` - Time in ms before half-open state (default: 30000)
- `RETRY_ATTEMPTS` - Maximum number of retry attempts (default: 3)
- `RETRY_INITIAL_DELAY` - Initial delay in ms before first retry (default: 1000)
- `USE_CBF_MODE` - Force fallback mode for testing (default: false)

### Resilience Factory

The implementation uses a Resilience Factory to make services resilient:

```typescript
// Make a service resilient
const resilientService = ResilienceFactory.makeResilient(
  originalService, 
  ['methodToMakeResilient', 'anotherMethod']
);
```

### Testing

To test the resilience patterns:
1. Set `USE_CBF_MODE=true` to force fallback mode
2. Use the `status` command to check circuit state
3. Look for [FALLBACK DATA] indicators in responses

Run the test script:
```
node scripts/test-agency-service.js
```

## Deployment

This branch is ready for review and merging. It follows the SS5-B1 workflow pattern with proper resilience patterns to ensure robust operation even during API failures.
