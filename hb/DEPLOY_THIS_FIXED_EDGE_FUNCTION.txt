ðŸ”§ CRITICAL FIX NEEDED: Replace your current Edge Function with this corrected version

The bug: h3.h3Distance() doesn't exist - should be h3.gridDistance()

DEPLOY THIS CODE TO YOUR SWIFT-API EDGE FUNCTION:

// Replace this line:
const gridSteps = h3.h3Distance(hospital.h3_bearing_point, h3Cell);

// With this line:
const gridSteps = h3.gridDistance(hospital.h3_bearing_point, h3Cell);

EXPECTED RESULT AFTER FIX:
- g_percent values will be > 0 for nearby geozips
- avg_grid_steps will show actual distances (not 0)
- materiality_filtered_count will be dramatically lower (5-15% of total)
- You should see realistic GIV territorial influence calculations

TEST COMMAND AFTER DEPLOYMENT:
SELECT * FROM golden_function_50_percent();

The fix should show:
- Hospital 100052: ~50-100 material geozips (not 174)
- Hospital 100075: ~80-150 material geozips (not 349)
- Realistic g_percent values based on distance decay
