I need to create a pull request for my implementation of {{pattern_name}} pattern in user story {{user_story}}.

Please help me:
1. Create a descriptive PR title following conventional commit format (feat/fix/docs/refactor: description)
2. Document the implemented patterns in the PR description, including:
   - Pattern names, status levels, and classification
   - Any adaptations or extensions made to the patterns
   - Justification for adaptations (if applicable)
3. Reference related issues or user stories
4. Include testing instructions
5. Document any changes to the pattern catalog

My PR should follow SS5-B1 workflow standards and communicate clearly:
- What patterns were implemented/adapted
- How the patterns were applied
- Any deviations from standard patterns and why
- What testing has been done

This will help the Pattern Steward conduct an effective review of my implementation.
