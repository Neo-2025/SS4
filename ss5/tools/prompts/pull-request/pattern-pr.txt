I need to create a pull request for my implementation of {{pattern_name}}.

Please help me:
1. Create a descriptive PR title following conventional commit format
2. Document the implemented patterns in the PR description
3. Include any pattern adaptations or extensions
4. Reference related issues or user stories
5. Include testing instructions

The PR should follow SS5-B1 workflow standards.
