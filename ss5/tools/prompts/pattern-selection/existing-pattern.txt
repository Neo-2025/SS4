I need to implement {{functionality}} using existing patterns from our SS5 catalog.

Please help me:
1. Identify relevant patterns from the catalog that match my requirements
2. Evaluate which patterns best fit my current needs
3. Determine if I need to adapt any patterns for my specific use case
4. Create an implementation plan using the selected patterns
5. Identify any potential pattern chains that would be useful

Consider pattern qualification levels (Draft, Candidate, Validated, Adaptive, Core) in your recommendations, prioritizing patterns with higher qualification levels.

This implementation will be part of user story {{user_story}}.
