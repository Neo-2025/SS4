I need to create a feature branch for implementing {{feature_name}} following the SS5-B1 workflow.

Important considerations:
1. Use the prefix 'feat/' followed by a descriptive name
2. Reference the user story ID if applicable (US-xxx)
3. Keep the branch name concise but descriptive
4. Focus on a single feature or pattern implementation

Example: feat/US-001-github-oauth

Please help me create an appropriate branch name and then suggest what patterns from the catalog might be relevant to this feature.
