Create a feature branch for implementing {{feature_name}} following the SS5-B1 workflow.

Important considerations:
1. Use the prefix 'feat/' followed by a descriptive name
2. Keep the branch name concise but descriptive
3. Include user story ID if applicable

Example: feat/auth-github-integration

Please help me create an appropriate branch name and then suggest what patterns from the catalog might be relevant to this feature.
