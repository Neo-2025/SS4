I need to create a bugfix branch for addressing {{bug_description}} following the SS5-B1 workflow.

Important considerations:
1. Use the prefix 'fix/' followed by a descriptive name
2. Reference the issue number if applicable (#xxx)
3. Keep the branch name concise but descriptive
4. Focus on fixing a specific issue

Example: fix/login-error-handling

Please help me create an appropriate branch name and then identify which patterns might be affected by this bug.
