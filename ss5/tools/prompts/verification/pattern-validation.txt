I need to validate my implementation of the {{pattern_name}} pattern.

Please help me:
1. Check if my implementation follows the pattern specification
2. Verify that I've implemented all required components
3. Ensure I'm using the correct interfaces
4. Address any potential issues or deviations

The pattern qualification level is {{qualification_level}}.

My implementation needs to meet the appropriate adherence level based on the pattern's qualification level:
- Core patterns: Strict adherence with minimal adaptation
- Adaptive patterns: Follow core structure with appropriate use of adaptation points
- Validated/Candidate patterns: Follow general structure with reasonable adaptation
- Draft patterns: Follow conceptual approach with flexible implementation

This validation is for user story {{user_story}} and I need to document any pattern adaptations in the pull request.
