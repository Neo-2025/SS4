I need to validate my implementation of the {{pattern_name}} pattern (Status: {{qualification_level}}).

Please help me:
1. Verify that my implementation follows the pattern specification
2. Confirm that I've implemented all required components and interfaces
3. Check that I've preserved the core elements of the pattern
4. Identify any potential issues or deviations from the pattern
5. Suggest improvements to better align with the pattern's intent

My implementation needs to meet the appropriate adherence level based on the pattern's qualification level:
- Core patterns: Strict adherence with minimal adaptation
- Adaptive patterns: Follow core structure with appropriate use of adaptation points
- Validated/Candidate patterns: Follow general structure with reasonable adaptation
- Draft patterns: Follow conceptual approach with flexible implementation

This validation is for user story {{user_story}} and I need to document any pattern adaptations in the pull request.
