I'm implementing the {{pattern_name}} pattern for {{functionality}}.

Please help me:
1. Implement the core pattern structure
2. Adapt the pattern to my specific requirements
3. Ensure I'm following the pattern's interfaces
4. Implement appropriate error handling and testing

I need to maintain pattern integrity while solving my specific use case.

Key considerations:
- The pattern's qualification level ({{qualification_level}}) indicates how strictly I should adhere to it
- I should document any adaptations for pattern stewardship

This implementation is part of user story {{user_story}} and relates to the following other patterns: {{related_patterns}}.
