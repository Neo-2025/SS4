I'm implementing the {{pattern_name}} pattern (Status: {{qualification_level}}) for {{functionality}}.

Please help me:
1. Implement the core pattern structure following the pattern's documentation
2. Adapt the pattern to my specific requirements while maintaining its integrity
3. Ensure I'm following the pattern's interfaces correctly
4. Implement appropriate error handling and testing
5. Document any adaptations I'm making to the pattern

Key considerations:
- The pattern's qualification level ({{qualification_level}}) indicates how strictly I should adhere to it
- I need to maintain pattern integrity while solving my specific use case
- I should document any adaptations for pattern stewardship

This implementation is part of user story {{user_story}} and relates to the following other patterns: {{related_patterns}}.
