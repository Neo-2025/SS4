# Bootstrap Script Generation

## Status: Candidate

## Classification: Process

## Problem
Setting up new projects with consistent structure, dependencies, and patterns requires significant effort and is prone to inconsistencies.

## Context
This pattern should be applied when starting new projects that implement User Story Suites using SS5 patterns.

## Solution
Automated bootstrap scripts that:
1. Set up the directory structure
2. Install dependencies with correct versions
3. Configure development environment
4. Initialize pattern-based components
5. Configure deployment settings

## Implementation Example
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Project bootstrap for USS-based implementation

# 1. Create directory structure
mkdir -p app/components app/lib app/public

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install next@15.2.3 react@18.2.0 react-dom@18.2.0
npm install -D typescript@5.4.3 tailwindcss@3.4.1

# 3. Initialize pattern-based components
# Component generation based on selected patterns
```

## Benefits
- Consistent project setup across implementations
- Reduced manual configuration errors
- Faster project initialization
- Pattern-based approach from project inception
