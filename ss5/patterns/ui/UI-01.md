# Responsive Card Grid

## Status: Draft

## Classification: UI Component

## Problem
Web applications need to display collections of items in an organized and visually appealing way that adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile devices to large desktop monitors. Traditional fixed layouts often break on smaller screens or waste space on larger ones.

## Solution
Implement a responsive card grid layout that automatically adjusts the number of columns based on available screen width, using CSS Grid or Flexbox with appropriate media queries.

```css
.card-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(300px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
  padding: 20px;
}

.card {
  background: white;
  border-radius: 8px;
  box-shadow: 0 2px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  overflow: hidden;
  transition: transform 0.3s ease, box-shadow 0.3s ease;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: translateY(-5px);
  box-shadow: 0 5px 15px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);
}
```

## Implementation
1. Create a container element with the class `card-grid`.
2. Add child elements with the class `card` for each item to display.
3. Adjust the `minmax` value (300px in the example) to control the minimum card width.
4. For more complex layouts, consider adding media queries for specific breakpoints.

```html
<div class="card-grid">
  <div class="card">
    <img src="image1.jpg" alt="Item 1">
    <div class="card-content">
      <h3>Item 1</h3>
      <p>Description for item 1</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- More cards here -->
</div>
```

## Benefits
- Automatically adapts to different screen sizes without additional JavaScript
- Maintains consistent spacing and alignment across all items
- Provides a clean, modern aesthetic that works well for various content types
- Improves user experience by presenting information in digestible chunks
- Reduces the need for horizontal scrolling on mobile devices

## Limitations
- Very large content within cards may create inconsistent heights
- Complex interactive elements might require additional JavaScript
- Extremely small screens may still need special handling
- Accessibility considerations for keyboard navigation between cards

## Related Patterns
- **Content Skeleton Loading**: Pair with loading placeholders to improve perceived performance
- **Lazy Image Loading**: Add lazy loading to images within cards for better performance
- **Filterable Collection**: Add filtering capabilities to the card grid
- **Card Expansion**: Allow cards to expand for additional details
